 - Pure functional design.
 - Everything is a plugin.
 - Designed following the principles of
[UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
 - Tiny codebase, very understandable.
 - Very well tested.
 - Ridiculously small API. After reading this file you will understand `Wand`
better than me.

## üí° Showcase: A hash router

`Wand` makes no assumptions about the environment it will be used in, and this
example can be easily migrated to a server-side router or any other type of
application.

```js
import wand from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marcodpt/wand/index.js"
```

## üìñ API

### wand({routes, plugins?, runtime}) => stop
 - `routes` **{route: action}**:
   - `route` **string**:
Accepts `*` to match any path and `:param` to declare variable.
   - `action` **state => done?**: 
A function that will be called every time `route` is matched.
     - `done` **state => ()**:
An optional function that will be called before the new `route` `action`, with
the `state` of the new `route` to end the current `route`.
 - `plugins` **[state => {...newData, ...state}]**:
An optional array of plugins, which are executed sequentially with each route
change and must return a object whose properties will be attached to
`state`.
 - `runtime` **change => finish?**:
The router `runtime`.
   - `change` **url => ()**:
Whenever called, it will trigger a `change` of `route`.
   - `finish` **state => ()**:
Optional function to terminate the `runtime`, receives the current `state` of
the `route` as a parameter.
 - `stop` **() => ()**:
Calls the `finish` function of the `runtime` with the contents of the current
`state`, and from then on any call to the `change` function within the
`runtime` will be ignored.

#### state {url, route, path, Params, query, Query, ...newData}
 - `url` **string**: 
The `url` as it was passed.
 - `route` **string**:
The `route` that matched as declared.
 - `path` **string**:
The part of the `url` before the `?`.
 - `Params` **Object**: 
Object containing the variables declared in the `route` with the associated
values in the current `path`.
 - `query` **string**:
The part of `url` after the `?`.
 - `Query` **Object**:
Parsed query string.
 - `newData`
New properties introduced by plugins.
